  <h2>WEEK 3 (video games)</h2>
  <div class="bodycopy">
    Design a game using Twine, Flowlab, gDevelop, or another game engine of your choice. Your game should be:
    <ul>
      <li>Short
        <ul>
          <li>a few minutes of gameplay is fine</li>
          <li>a few seconds is also fine if it fits the themes of your game</li>
          <li>there is no specific time limit, but anything approaching an hour is most likely overkill</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Meaningful
        <ul>
          <li>your game should tell the player something</li>
          <li>this doesn’t mean it needs a narrative or even formal representation — plenty of art has neither and still “says something” to the viewer</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    You may work in pairs or small groups on this project but everyone must provide their own documentation of their own work.

  <h3>Pong (Construct 3) — Week 3 Deliverable</h3>

  <div class="bodycopy" style="max-width: 960px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
    <p>
      I decided to build a classic Pong game. Although most of my experience is with Unity, I picked
      <strong>Construct 3</strong> for this assignment after researching tools that are simpler for
      quick, small games. Construct uses a block-style workflow (similar in spirit to Unity’s component approach,
      but simpler), so I was able to put the game together quickly and focus on gameplay.
      It’s player vs. computer. I used AI for guidance (<em>ChatGPT 5</em>) to help troubleshoot and refine the logic.
